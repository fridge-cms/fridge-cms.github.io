# Content Type Reference

Content types have many different options for completely customizing how content is displayed within Fridge.

---

### Display Options

#### Sort Method

Control the default way content is sorted.

* __Date__ - Content is sorted using its created date.
* __Manual__ - Content is sorted manually. Use the drag toggle to reorder content.
* __Hierarchy__ - Content is organized into a tree. Use the drag toggle to organize.

#### Sort Order

Change the direction of the sorted content. If using `Manual` or `Hierarchy` sort methods, the sort order should be *Ascending*.

#### Layout

The display layout controls how the content should be displayed in Fridge's dashboard.

* __Default__ - A standard layout displaying content in rows.
* __Card__ - Grid based layout using cards to display content. Great for displaying images.
* __Table__ - Data focused layout that supports showing multiple columns of data for each row of content.
* __Tree__ - Organizes content into a tree hierarchy using the default layout. *This layout is required when using the Hierarchy sort method*.

#### Fields

If using a display layout that supports showing multiple fields, you can pick and choose which fields will be displayed.

#### Columns

Control how many columns are used in the grid when viewing the content edit screen.

### API Options

#### API Access

If this option is checked, this content will be available through the API using the publishable key. All content is entirely accessible when using the secret key.

#### Public Access

If checked content of this type will be able to be created using the public API endpoint. See [Public Content Creation](/docs/api#public-content-creation) in the API reference for more information.

#### Notify on creation

Have Fridge optionally send an email notification when content is created using the public API endpoint. This works perfectly when creating contact forms or user-based submissions.
