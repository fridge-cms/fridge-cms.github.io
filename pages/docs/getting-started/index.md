## Content Types

Content types are used to describe the different kinds of content that are needed in a Fridge. Think of content types as high level names to describe content *(i.e. Blog Post, Page, Event, Person, Comment.)* Content types are made up of __parts__ which describe each piece of content that makes up the content type. There are several different content parts to create practically any kind of content type which can be seen in greater detail in the [Parts Reference]().

### Creating The First Content Type

After logging into Fridge for the first time, you are presented with a clean slate. This is on purpose as a Fridge should not make any assumptions about what kind of content you need or don't need for your project. As such, create a content type to get started!

## Creating Content

After you have created a content type, it will appear in the Fridge sidebar. Clicking on the content type displays a list of all content of that type, as well as ways to create new content. When creating a new piece of content of a particular type, all of the content parts from that type are presented as input fields in a beautiful rich layout.
